# Corda Training Project code

This repository contains the projects that accompany the Corda Training provided by R3 Corda, which you can find at [https://training.corda.net](https://training.corda.net).

Each folder in this repository represents one step as described in the course.

To use Kotlin to compile these, set `useKotlin=true` in `constants.properties`.
